 ## Tracking U.S. Covid-19 Cases, Deaths and Other Metrics By State
 #### Why this article, why this data visualization:
Even though, we have all adjusted into our new way of life with the pandemic, I believe that knowing about ***Covid 19*** and its trends and patterns in terms of how it spread around the world is very important to not let events like this repeat. In this way, I chose this data visualization, a line graph, because it makes it very easy to understand what trends and patterns are. I found this data visualization through an article in Washington Post by searching up with the keyword of "covid cases."\

 #### What does this data visualization show:
This data visualization shows the trends and patterns of covid death cases through spikes and sharp decreases in such cases. These covid deaths are recorded through February 29th of 2020 through October 11th of 2022. The number of deaths are recorded in thousandths and are shown as a line graph to show its changes in average number of deaths each month. Overall I think that this line graph informs the reader of the average number of deaths from covid as well as big changes through a time period\
**Who**: The washington post produced the data visualization to make the information reguarding trends in recent covid deaths more visable to their viewers\
**Date**: March 27th 2020\
**Stakeholders**: The audience for this visualizations are washington post subscribers and ordinary people living in U.S. This visualization may indirectly imapct the lives of all citizens of U.S. as the government may use these data visualizations to implement changes to reduce the deaths.\
**Interests**: Since this data visualization shows the number of deaths, this number may come as a shock to those living in the U.S. and may cause them to leave the country in fear of their safety. Not only that but it can also have the opposite effect of people thinking that pandemic is over and therefore they can start going around more and increasing the risk for everyone\
**Key fact**: This visualization shows the average death from covid 19 from 2020 to 2022, showing trends and patterns that can be used to predict future patterns as well as to be used in changes to be implemented. THis also allows citizens to get a better idea of the state of the country in terms of the pandemic\
**Power** : Inequality in our modern society is greatly reflected in the graph because significantly greater proportions of the deaths recorded come from certain groups of people like minorities. They often get less tools to keep themselves protected and are often the ones to be forced into more exposed enviornments
> "Data feminism is a way of thinking about data, both their use and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought (D'ignazio 4)."

Some issues that my data visualization could have is:
- difficulty in looking at patterns in shorter periods of time
- possibility of less accurate depiction of average death rate due to outlier data
- doesn't show demographic patterns based on age, gender or race

Another issue related to my data visualization given this definition and my reading, is that first standard practices in data science, including these ways to visualize data, serve to reinforce these existing inequalities. Feminism in the book Data Feminism. claims to challenge and change the distribution of power through data science. More than that, the underlying data feminism is said to be a belief in the idea that oppressive systems of power harm all of us, that they undermine the quality and validity of our work and that they hinder us from creatin true and lasting social impact with data science. Though seemingly less related to my specific data visualization, I think the overarching idea remains same, as there are parts to data science that reinforce inequalities and such example could by my specific line graph.
