 ## Tracking U.S. Covid-19 Cases, Deaths and Other Metrics By State
 #### Why this article, why this data visualization:
Even though, we have all adjusted into our new way of life with the pandemic, I believe that knowing about Covid 19 and its trends and patterns in terms of how it spread around the world is very important to not let events like this repeat. In this way, I chose this data visualization, a line graph, because it makes it very easy to understand what trends and patterns are. I found this data visualization through an article in Washington Post by searching up with the keyword of "covid cases."\

 #### What does this data visualization show:
This data visualization shows the trends and patterns of covid death cases through spikes and sharp decreases in such cases. These covid deaths are recorded through February 29th of 2020 through October 11th of 2022. The number of deaths are recorded in thousandths and are shown as a line graph to show its changes in average number of deaths each month. Overall I think that this line graph informs the reader of the average number of deaths from covid as well as big changes through a time period. \

> "Data feminism is a way of thinking about data, both their use and their limits, that is informed by direct experience, by a commitment to action, and by intersectional feminist thought (D'ignazio 4)."

 One issue related to my data visualization given this definition and my reading, is that first standard practices in data science, including these ways to visualize data, serve to reinforce these existing inequalities. Feminism in the book Data Feminism. claims to challenge and change the distribution of power through data science. More than that, the underlying data feminism is said to be a belief in the idea that oppressive systems of power harm all of us, that they undermine the quality and validity of our work and that they hinder us from creatin true and lasting social impact with data science. Though seemingly less related to my specific data visualization, I think the overarching idea remains same, as there are parts to data science that reinforce inequalities and such example could by my specific line graph.
